# Orca_Final_Project

# This project will analyze which genese are under positive selection in orcas whales, and what roles they play in unique traits, such as social behaviors and hunting strategies.

# Hypothesis: Genes under positive selection in orcas are associated with specific social behaviors and hunting strategies, and that ecotypes with similiar behaviors will share common genetic traits. 

# Approach: 
#  1) Sequence alignment
#          - Map sequencing reads to reference orca genome
#  2) SNP calling 
#          - Identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), insertions, & deletion (INDELs)
#  3) VCF tools/files
#          - Find genetic differences that may contribute to ecotype-specific traits
#  4) Phylogenetic Analysis and PCA 
#          - Visualize genomic variation among ecotypes
